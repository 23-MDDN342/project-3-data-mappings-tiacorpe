## 2023 MDDN342 Assignment 3: Data Mappings

Swapped out the eternals photo for this one; I think it was having trouble with it because it's a bit dim & zoomed out.
Also adjusted the training values a bit for the teeth. Decided it has to be a proper cheesey smile for it to count as a 'yes'. I relabeled the slider accordingly.

In saying that, despite the training values being correct for their corresponding images, when those same images come up in the training quiz they're not always the same. Maybe I just assumed they would be, not really sure if it shows a fault in the training, the system in recognising faces, or all of the above?

For the most part though, when I did the quiz's I was getting more right than wrong. I've found the key thing it struggles with is the fem./masc. variable. At this stage I've done all I can though, so I've jsut mentioned these flaws more in depth in my documentation.
