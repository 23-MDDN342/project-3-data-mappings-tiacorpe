## 2023 MDDN342 Assignment 3: Data Mappings

Sooooo I failed, exponentially!!! Mismanaged my time today & misjudged how long travelling home was going to take with the long weekend traffic - to top it off, I was driving so wasn't even able to grind on the way. So unfortunately my 5% 'L' is now a 10% one.

In light of this, I've taken the time to tweak my code even more and weed out some of the weaknesses I feel I can improve with the extra 24 hrs of time. I'll probably include all this in the documentation as well; the lateness just further adds to the dramatic effect lolz.

THINGS I WANT TO CHANGE:
- outputs feel inconsistent; initially I prefered the way the mask features adjusted completely to the sample images & that the differing slider variables were more subtle. But in looking it over again, I don't like how inconsistent they feel & think the slider variables would be nicer if they were more distinct.

- theme could be more 'dramatic'; carrying on from the last bit, when I decided to ditch the idea of pre-set emotion faces for the more difficult mapping option (of mapping every bloody feature & tweaking them so the bloody eyebrows didn't zoom of the mask), I thought I'd like it more. But I think the theatre mask idea that this technically originated from, should be stronger. Especially since I didn't do the classic hugely exaggerated emotions in project 2 either, it'd feel like a missed opportunity if I didn't do it at all.

- some of the colours; I like that I simplified these down more to less options and the basic colour palette. I think it helps make it more dramatic and bold. I'm not 100% sure if I'll settle with the grey though, or find an equally bold colour that has the same timeless effect?
