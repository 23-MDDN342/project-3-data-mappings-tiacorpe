## 2023 MDDN342 Assignment 3: Data Mappings

Fixed up the bugs that were going on with my project 2 code. Turns out it was to do with the variables: 
1) Forgetting to define the colour changing variable.
2) Forgetting to add this. to some of the if statement variables.

After getting those sorted, things were back up and running smoothly, so I added in the last of my sliders as well.
