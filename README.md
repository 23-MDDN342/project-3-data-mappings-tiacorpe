## 2023 MDDN342 Assignment 3: Data Mappings

So obviously got a bit ahead of myself with the sliders and made them like they were in project 2, but they've been a little helpful so far at deciding what characteristics I want to train with etc. At this stage I think I'll have 3+ sliders:
- S1; Changes the mask colour based on the skin tone [4 values].
- S2; Changes the backing mask colour based on hair colour/darkness? [3-4 values].
- S3; Changes eye colour based on masc./fem. features [2 values].

I've adjusted all the features to move in regards to the face points. Intially I was considerting having preset faces, and having those be decided based on the individuals differences, but I like being able to see the variety of masks that this creates more. At most, I think I'd do one more slider, max., to represent the difference, but I'm not sure yet what else it'd track/change so I may very well end up sticking to the minimum requirent of 3. One thing that I'm happy with is how the mask adjusts to the chin shape. In my project 2 code, the mask was more curvy/smooth, whereas this one has more visible corners. I chose to keep these because I quite like how they're indictive of the faces direction (it's more subtle with a curvier edge). Also, the iris/pupil isn't accurate in placement with the way the face landmarks are set up, so I just had it put in the middle instead.
