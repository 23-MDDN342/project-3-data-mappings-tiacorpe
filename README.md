## 2023 MDDN342 Assignment 3: Data Mappings

For this project, the aim was to map attributes of faces in images onto our own parameterized faces. For this, I chose to reuse code from my previous project, and continue with the aesthetic of exaggerated theatre masks. For the masks features, I wanted the placement to remain relatively controlled and intact, so I had them change according to the y-value of the nose_bridge, left_eye, top_lip, and chin (with addtional tweaks). These make each mask a little more distinctive based on the placement of the features alone.

For the differing attributes, I chose to focus on skin tone (3 values), femininity & masculinity (2 values), cheesy smiles/teeth (2 values), & hair tone (3 values).
    Skin Tone: this changed the mask colour (shades of grey to look more dramatic/bold).
    Fem./Masc.: this changed the eyebrows from looking sad, to angry (e.g. stereotypical gender emotives).
    Cheesy Smiese: this changed the eyes from looking closed, to open (e.g. not visible & visible).
    Hair Tone: this changed the mouth.
