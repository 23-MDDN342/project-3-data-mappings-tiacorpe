## 2023 MDDN342 Assignment 3: Data Mappings

Mucked up the sliders across the boad when I changed them so had to cntrl-Z all that and train again. Third times a charm? :D

In changing it back I had to fix the issues with the sliders; as it was having trouble dividing 100 by 4 it seemed, so my values were coming out a bit dodgy and the wrong colours were showing up. To make a quick fix, I changed the colours used from shades of brown to 3 different shades of grey, and adjusted everything else accordingly. I'm actually happier with this look to be honest. I'm also glas I cut it down t three as the 4th value wasn't showing a great deal of difference from the 3rd (with both the skin and hair tone).
