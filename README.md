## 2023 MDDN342 Assignment 3: Data Mappings

Further readjusted the sliders and their effects.
Slider 1; Tracks the skin tones & effects the mask colour (3 values).
Slider 2; Tracks the fem./masc. & effects the eyebrows (2 values).
Slider 3; Tracks if the teeth are visible & effects the eyes (2 values).
Slider 4; Tracks the hair tone & effects the mouth (3 values).

In terms of the facial landmarks, I've further refined the influence these have on the Y position on the mask features. Intitally these were all moving based on the origin point of the mask, which I had set to the end of the nose bridge. This point is now only being used for the mask/mask backing.
The eyebrows, eyes, & mouth are now set according to their respective facial features; though I had to adjust these so were still being drawn within a reasonable distance of each other - but they are still influenced by those respective facial landmarks.

For the fem./masc. slider, I chose to use the expressive 'sad' & 'angry' eyebrows because I thought it kind of illuded to the traditional gender stereotypes/roles in older media. e.g. men would get angry alot and women would cry alot. I thought this paired nicely with the theatre theme.
